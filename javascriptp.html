                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>What is JavaScript ?</b> <br>
                    <br> JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted
                    compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is
                    well-known for
                    the
                    development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.<br>

                    JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side
                    developments
                    as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of
                    language.
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language
                    elements like operators, control structures, and statements.
                <p><br><br>
                    <b>Client-side:</b> It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                    Like if
                    client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
                    events
                    such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client side are
                    AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.
                </p><br><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Server-side:</b> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For if the
                    server-side
                    extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of
                    information
                    from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The
                    useful
                    framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.
                </p><br><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Imperative language </b> In this type of language we are mostly concerned about how it is to be
                    done.
                    It
                    simply controls the flow of computation. The procedural programming approach, object, oriented
                    approach
                    comes under this as async await we are thinking about what is to be done further after the async
                    call.
                </p><br><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Declarative programming </b>: In this type of language we are concerned about how it is to be
                    done,
                    basically here logical computation requires. Her main goal is to describe the desired result without
                    direct dictation on how to get it as the arrow function does.
                </p>

                <h2>How to Link JavaScript File in HTML ?</h2>JavaScript can be added to HTML file in two ways: <ul>
                    <li>Internal JS: We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the
                        script
                        tag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        External JS: We can write JavaScript code in another files having an extension.js and then link
                        this
                        file inside the head tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="History">
                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going
                    to
                    be
                    named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, JavaScript language has no
                    concept
                    of
                    input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up
                    to
                    the
                    host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common
                    host
                    environment is the browser. </p>

                <h1>Features of JavaScript</h1>
                <p>According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on
                    earth.
                    <br>
                    With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and
                    other
                    frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more. Here are a few things that we can do with
                    JavaScript:
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly
                        static,
                        after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.</li>
                    <li>Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like other objects. They
                        can
                        be
                        passed as arguments in other functions.</li>
                    <li>Can handle date and time.</li>
                    <li>Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML</li>
                    <li>No compiler is needed.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Applications of JavaScript</h1>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web Development: Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do
                        this in
                        1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.</li><br>
                    <li>Web Applications: With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language was
                        required
                        to
                        create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click
                        and
                        drag
                        the mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of
                        JavaScript.
                        It
                        uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron
                        and
                        React are helpful in this department.
                        Server Applications: With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to server and
                        Node.js
                        is the most powerful on the server side.</li><br>
                    <li>Games: Not only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The
                        combination of
                        JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It provides the
                        EaseJS
                        library which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.</li><br>
                    <li>Art: Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to draw on HTML 5
                        canvas,
                        and
                        make the sound more effective also can be used p5.js library.</li><br>
                    <li>Machine Learning: This JavaScript ml5.js library can be used in web development by using machine
                        learning.</li>

                    JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g.,

                    some
                    data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).</p>
