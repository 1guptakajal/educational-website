            <h2>Introduction to Computer</h2><br>
            <p>Being a modern-day kid you must have used, seen, or read about computers. This is because they are an
                integral part of our everyday existence. Be it school, banks, shops, railway stations, hospital or your
                own home, computers are present everywhere, making our work easier and faster for us. As they are such
                integral parts of our lives, we must know what they are and how they function. Let us start with
                defining the term computer formally.<br><br>

                The literal meaning of computer is a device that can calculate. However, modern computers can do a lot
                more than calculate. Computer is an electronic device that receives input, stores or processes the input
                as per user instructions and provides output in desired format.</p>
            <br><h2>Input-Process-Output Model</h2><br>
            <p>Computer input is called data and the output obtained after processing it, based on user’s instructions
                is called information. Raw facts and figures which can be processed using arithmetic and logical
                operations to obtain information are called data.<br>
                The processes that can be applied to data are of two types − <br>

            <p>Arithmetic operations − Examples include calculations like addition, subtraction, differentials,
                square root, etc.</p> <br>
            <p>Arithmetic operations − Examples include calculations like addition, subtraction, differentials,
                square root, etc.</p><br>

            </p><br>
            <p>The basic parts of a computer are as follows − </p><br>

            <p>Input Unit − Devices like keyboard and mouse that are used to input data and instructions to the
                computer are called input unit.</p> <br>
            <p>Output Unit − Devices like printer and visual display unit that are used to provide information to
                the user in desired format are called output unit.</p><br>
            <p>Control Unit − As the name suggests, this unit controls all the functions of the computer. All
                devices or parts of computer interact through the control unit.</p><br>
            <p>Arithmetic Logic Unit − This is the brain of the computer where all arithmetic operations and
                logical operations take place</p><br>
            <p>Memory − All input data, instructions and data interim to the processes are stored in the memory.
                Memory is of two types – primary memory and secondary memory. Primary memory resides within the CPU
                whereas secondary memory is external to it.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p>Control unit, arithmetic logic unit and memory are together called the central processing unit or
                CPU. Computer devices like keyboard, mouse, printer, etc. that we can see and touch are the hardware
                components of a computer. The set of instructions or programs that make the computer function using
                these
                hardware parts are called software. We cannot see or touch software. Both hardware and software are
                necessary for working of a computer.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Characteristics of Computer</h2>To understand why computers are such an important part of our lives, let
            us look at some of its characteristics − <br>
            <p>Speed − Typically, a computer can carry out 3-4 million instructions per second.</p><br>
            <p>Accuracy − Computers exhibit a very high degree of accuracy. Errors that may occur are usually due
                to inaccurate data, wrong instructions or bug in chips – all human errors.</p><br>
            <p>Reliability − Computers can carry out same type of work repeatedly without throwing up errors due to
                tiredness or boredom, which are very common among humans.</p><br>
            <p>Versatility − Computers can carry out a wide range of work from data entry and ticket booking to
                complex mathematical calculations and continuous astronomical observations. If you can input the
                necessary data with correct instructions, computer will do the processing.</p><br>
            <p>Storage Capacity − Computers can store a very large amount of data at a fraction of cost of
                traditional storage of files. Also, data is safe from normal wear and tear associated with paper.
            </p><br>

            <p>
            <h2>Advantages of Using Computer</h2>Now that we know the characteristics of computers, we can see the
            advantages that computers offer− <br>
            <p>Computers can do the same task repetitively with same accuracy.</p><br>
            <p>Computers do not get tired or bored.</p><br>
            <p>Computers can take up routine tasks while releasing human resource for more intelligent functions.
            </p><br>

            <p>
            <h2>Disadvantages of Using Computer</h2> Despite so many advantages, computers have some disadvantages of
            their own −<br>
            <p>Disadvantages of Using Computer</p><br>
            <p>Regular electric supply is necessary to make computers work, which could prove difficult everywhere
                especially in developing nations.</p><br>


            <p>
            <h2>Booting</h2>Starting a computer or a computer-embedded device is called booting. Booting takes place in
            two steps − <br>
            <p>Switching on power supply</p><br>
            <p>Loading operating system into computer’s main memory</p><br>
            <p>Keeping all applications in a state of readiness in case needed by the user</p><br>
            <p>The first program or set of instructions that run when the computer is switched on is called BIOS or
                Basic Input Output System. BIOS is a firmware, i.e. a piece of software permanently programmed into the
                hardware.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If a system is already running but needs to be restarted, it is called rebooting. Rebooting may be
                required
                if a software or hardware has been installed or system is unusually slow.</p>


            <p><b>There are two types of booting −</b></p>

            <p>Cold Booting − When the system is started by switching on the power supply it is called cold
                booting. The next step in cold booting is loading of BIOS.</p><br>
            <p>Warm Booting − When the system is already running and needs to be restarted or rebooted, it is
                called warm booting. Warm booting is faster than cold booting because BIOS is not reloaded.</p><br>
